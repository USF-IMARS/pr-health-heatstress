Dashboard prototype for exploring satellite-derived LST products combined with human health data.

## product selection
Datasets available in GEE can be explored [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/tags/surface-temperature).

The dataset list was analyzed August 2025 and the following dataset selection was made.

MOD21A1D (Terra, daytime) + MYD21A1D (Aqua, daytime) pair and combine them per day. 
They’re both daily, 1 km, and use the newer TES (Temperature–Emissivity Separation) algorithm (generally higher fidelity than the older split-window MOD11 line), and Terra/Aqua give you two daytime looks (~10:30 & ~13:30 local) to cut cloud gaps and better capture peak heat.

Why these over the others:

Highest spatial resolution among your daily options (1 km). The CMG “C1/C2/C3” products are 0.05° (~5.6 km)—too coarse for neighborhood-scale heat stress in Puerto Rico. 


Daily cadence (not 8-day/monthly composites like 11A2/21C2/21C3).

Algorithm: MOD21/MYD21 use TES + an improved water-vapor scaling scheme specifically designed to stabilize retrievals in warm, humid conditions—relevant for PR. MOD11/MYD11 use the older split-window approach. 

Diurnal coverage: Terra ≈ 10:30 and Aqua ≈ 13:30 local overpasses; fusing both improves daily chance of a clear observation and better approximates daytime heat exposure. (Night versions—A1N—are great if you also care about nocturnal heat).
